Dataset of "A preliminary analysis of methods for curvature estimation on surfaces with local reliefs" by Elia Moscoso Thompson, Silvia Biasotti

ply_models: folder of the 7 ply models used in [1]. Models are rotated and scaled as in Figure 2 of [1]. The models are represented by triangulations. All the models but model7 have no boundary. All the models have one shell and no handles. The files are archived in a splitted zip file due to the upload size limitation of GitHub. For linux and mac user, there should be no problem in unzipping the files. For windows, any 7zip equivalent works fine.
png_previews: folder of the 7 png images of the models in ply_models.
