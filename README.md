Datasets used for "The role of mesh quality and mesh quality indicators in the Virtual Element Method" by T. Sorgente, S. Biasotti, G. Manzini and M. Spagnuolo, https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04138.
These datasets have been created through the generation algorithms presented in the Appendix B of the paper.

## Content
The files are organized in folders corresponding to the different generation techniques and subfolders relative to the different datasets.
Each dataset is composed of a collection of .off or .obj files numbered increasingly as "Namestep.obj/off", being "Name" the name of the dataset and "step" the refinement step. For example, the first mesh of dataset D_Maze is "Maze0.obj".

In "png_previews" there are visual representations of all the datasets: each image shows a selection of four meshes from that dataset, with decreasing meshsize.

Here a complete list of the content of each folder:
- Reference: folder containing the reference dataset D_Triangle.
- Hybrid: folder containing the hybrid datasets D_Maze and D_Star.
- Mirroring: folder containing the mirroring datasets D_Jenga, D_Slices and D_Ulike.
- Mirroring_x4: folder containing the multiple mirroring datasets D_Jenga4, D_Slices4 and D_Ulike4.
- png_previews: folder containing the png preview images of the datasets.
